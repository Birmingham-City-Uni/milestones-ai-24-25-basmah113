## Overview

This file contains the development of an Artificial Intelligence Game project created using Unity and Visual Studio. The game focuses on implementing AI agents, advanced gameplay mechanics such as Boss Battles and Finite State Machines. It includes descriptions of the game's structure, development progress, technologies used and instructions for setup and contributions. 

## Description of the Game

The game is a Level 1 Boss Battle where the protagonist, a human warrior, battles a Dracula, who appears to be very powerful/terrifying vampire leader. Dracula appears as a slightly larger, more imposing figure in this dramatic battle, towering over the human warrior to signify the difficult task that lies ahead. There will be Dracula's bat minions who are AI-controlled agents that the human player must carefully combat while avoiding waves of them. The gameplay will become more difficult as a result of these bat agents spawning periodically throughout the battle. As Dracula's faithful slaves, the bats attack the player from every angle, requiring them to continuously strike a balance between attack and defence. The player must carefully dodge the harm caused by the bats in addition to using direct battle to exhaust his health in order to beat Dracula. Both Dracula and the bats' behaviours will be controlled by different Finite State Machines (FSMs), which will make their actions dynamic and difficult. While Dracula will have several states, including Idle, Attack, and Retreat, the bats will gather around the player and do damage occasionally in response to health thresholds and distance checks. Both the player and the enemy will have health checks in the game. The player's and Dracula's health bar will drop when they sustain damage. Throughout the game level, power-ups will be positioned strategically to give players the chance to regain their health at certain times. The game will become increasingly challenging as Dracula's health declines, increasing the strain in the closing seconds of the fight as the AI system carefully controls the bat agents' behaviour and spawning. The Game will also distance-based attacks including Close Range and Mid to Long Range. In Close Range, if the player gets too close in distance to Dracula, he will use devastating melee strikes, including strong bites. In Mid to Long Range, if the player stays farther away, the Dracula will resort to ranged attacks such as sending out waves of bats. 

## Game Mechanics

1. Main Character: A Human Warrior who uses weapons to fight off Dracula and his Bat Minions.
  
2. Dracula (Main Boss): The Ultimate Boss is a large, strong vampire king. His attacks are deadline and his size increases his reach and strength. He will fight in phases, growing more violent as his health decreases.
  
3. Bat Minions (AI Agents): The AI-Controlled bats will be spawning throughout the level. They are the player's constant threat and act as additional enemies. AI logic will determine their behaviour (including attack patterns) and frequency of spawning, resulting in a dynamic battlefield.
  
4. Finite State Machines:
  
 - Dracula: Dracula will be able to move between the following states: Idle, Attack, Summon Minions, Damage, and Retreat. This will make battles unpredictable and interesting.
 
 - Bats: Bats will interact with the player and determine their attack patterns using an FSM.
 
5. Health Checks: When an enemy or player sustains harm, their health declines. Throughout the fight, strategically placed power-ups will be available to restore health.
   
6. Distance Checks: AI Agents will decide how frequently to attack depending on how far away they are from the player, making positioning in the game more tactically challenging.
   
7. Damage System:  A well-balanced mechanism that determines the amount of damage caused by the player and enemies according to attack type and proximity.

## Background/Motivation

The game has been inspired by my childhood interest with vampires, especially the mythical Dracula. Because of their mysterious nature, life expectancy, and sinister charm, vampires have always captivated me. My decision to create my game on a boss fight with Dracula was driven by this obsession. My goal is to draw players into a gothic, spooky setting that relies on this immortal mythos by include vampires and bats. In order to further establish Dracula as a terrifying opponent, it has been decided to make him somewhat larger than human warrior, which leaves the player feeling powerless and in fear. I choose to concentrate on Finite State Machines (FSMs) for the AI behaviour because I want to provide an engaging and difficult experience. Since FSMs enable more complex opponent behaviour, boss battles become unpredictable and fascinating. In order to balance the game's difficulty level and provide the player with feedback on their performance, I'm also including health and distance checks. By attacking the player at crucial times when they are most exposed, the AI agents (bats) will be vital in raising the tension. These agents will be called out by Dracula at certain health thresholds, which is closely related to his combat plan.

## Tutor Feedback Reflection

**Week 3 Feedback**
- **Feedback:** Add more detailed descriptions in README and organize project folders better. Also start implementing AI Agents in the Game, detailing their actions/roles and determine how to manage the frequency of damaging the Main Boss of my game.
- **Action Taken:** Updated README with clearer descriptions, folder structure, and added weekly logbook for reflection. Started planning AI Agents for my game. I roughly designed the Dracula Boss as the main character and implemented bat agents to act as enemies. These bat agents will be spawned at intervals, with their actions revolving around attacking the main character. I also began planning their behaviors using finite state machines (FSM), focusing on their damage-dealing frequency and how they will coordinate with the Main Boss (Dracula) to create a challenging gameplay experience. Incorporated health and distance checks to manage how often the AI Agents damage the Main Boss, ensuring the game balance and player engagement.

**Week 4 Feedback (Milestone 1)**
- **Feedback:** I have been awarded 5.00 marks for my first milestone for GitHub Repro. The feedback which I received was to link the GitHub Project within the repository, as it was externally done. 
- **Action Taken:** I had a discussion with Dr.Carlo to invite me to the BCU organization so I can link my Project accurately within the repository. Then after I had access, I added the projects to my repository. I also worked on my Pull Request Code reviews in the github repository and also I made sure to fix the issue with my CI /CD Build Issue in the repository.
